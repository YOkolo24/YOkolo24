### Hi there 👋

My name is Yvonne and here's a little about me:

- 🔭 I’ve recently completed an Entry to Tech bootcamp in collaboration with Coding Black Females and UBS to learn more about software engineering & development utilising the Java programming language!🤓
- 🌱 I’m mostly focused on learning the fundamentals at the moment, but I'm looking forward to being more knowledgable as I'm exposed to more projects!
- ⚡ Fun facts: My favourite colour is orange and I don't like hot drinks!

Looking forward to collaborating in the near future! 😁
