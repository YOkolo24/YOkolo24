### Hi there 👋

My name is Yvonne and here's a little about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working with the CBF Academy and I'm on an Entry to Tech bootcamp training to become a software engineer!🤓
- 🌱 I’m mostly focused on learning the fundamentals at the moment, but I'm looking forward to being more knowledgable as the bootcamp progresses on and I make the transition into the tech world!
- ⚡ Fun facts: My favourite colour is orange and I don't like hot drinks!

Looking forward to collaborating in the near future! 😁
